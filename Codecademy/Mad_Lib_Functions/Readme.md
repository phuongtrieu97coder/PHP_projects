# Mad Lib Functions

# 1. Introduction:
In this project, we’ll use PHP to write a function to fill in a Mad Libs story! Mad Libs are short stories with blank spaces, which get filled in by the user. The result is usually funny (or strange).

Mad Libs require:

+ A short story with blank spaces (asking for different types of words).
  <br>
+ Words to fill in those blanks.
  <br>

For this project, we provide the story, but it will be up to you to create a function that:

+ Takes desired words as arguments. <br>
+ Returns the story with the words put into blanks in the right place.
