# Find Trending And New Movie Watching Contents


# 1.Purpose:

- This project is a small part of THP_Movie_Streaming_PHP Web App that is used to find trending and new movie contents from this webpage.

- This project can be used to learn how to connect AJAX + PHP + MySQL to select and get specific data based on specific conditions.

- This project helps developers know how to get trending contents data based on the total watching times of each movies according to each user's watching content in a specific month.

- It also helps developers know how to get new contents data based on the contents that were added in a specific month or week.

# 2.How it work:

> When users visit the page, they can see two buttons as 'TRENDING' and 'NEW ON THPSM'. TRENDING button is activated and it opens the block that contains all the trending movies. In addition, this button has bottom white bar to show users that it is activated.

> When Trending button is activated, it connects to AJAX, AJAX connects to PHP, and PHP connects to MySQL to get specific data, then display it on the page.

> If users click 'NEW ON THPSM', the contents block is going to get new movie contents data based on different PHP and SQL algorithm. 

> The contents block shows user 6 movies first, and divided by 3 columns with 2 rows. If the result shows more than 6 movies, then users can scroll down the block to see more movies.
